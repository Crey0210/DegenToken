# MODULE-4 DegenToken
This is the assessment for the last module of ETH + AVAX PROOF: Intermediate EVM Course.
We're going to complete the difficulties assigned to us in this last module! It includes burning, minting, transferring, redeeming, and checking tokens!

# Description
This module, the final ETH AVAX, was created using Remix Ethereum, a programming language for producing tokens and other NFTs. Because OpenZepplin has a GitHub that generates your first code automatically without requiring you to input it in, the scripts listed below can be extremely useful. All it requires is some more code and minting! completed really soon.

# Getting Started
Open the Remix Ethereum IDE and click the "+" symbol to create a new file in the left-hand file explorer window. Paste the contract code into the editor.

Go to the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the sidebar on the left. Select the Solidity compiler version (0.8.18 in this case) that matches the pragma declaration in your contract. Then, click the "Compile DegenToken.sol" button to complete the contract and add functions such as mining, redeeming, transferring, and balancing your token!

# Executing the Code
When you're finished, press Ctrl + S to verify your code for discrepancies. If there are none, you're finished! You've moved on to the next phase! On the left sidebar, click the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab. Click "Deploy" after selecting the "DegenToken" contract from the drop-down menu. Verify the transaction, and the contract should be activated shortly after!
